# COMP9517_GW: Comparative Study and Deployment of Classical and Deep Learning Models in Computer Vision

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This private repository hosts the codebase for our COMP9517 group project. The focus of our work is to implement, evaluate, and compare both traditional machine learning (ML) and modern deep learning (DL) models for various computer vision tasks.

Our study includes deployment pipelines and performance analysis across different model families ranging from classical approaches to state-of-the-art architectures.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members

- **Cindy Chen**
- **Jiaming Yang**
- **Kejing Wang**
- **Ning Wu**
- **Xin Kun Lin**

## ðŸ“š Scope and Methodology

The project will explore and benchmark the following models and methods:

### âœ… Traditional Machine Learning Models
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### âœ… Deep Learning Architectures
- **ResNet (Residual Networks)**
- **Swin Transformer**
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**

Our objective is to analyze these models in terms of accuracy, speed, resource consumption, and deployment complexity.

## ðŸš€ Deployment and Experimentation

- Benchmarking experiments will be run on various datasets and deployment platforms.
- The performance of each model will be evaluated using standardized metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, inference latency).
- Multiple deployment strategies will be tested (e.g., local server, edge devices, cloud services).

## ðŸ’¡ Innovations

We plan to introduce novel comparisons and improvements in deployment strategies. These innovations and technical contributions will be detailed in future updates.

## ðŸ“… Project Timeline

The development timeline and key milestones will be outlined in an upcoming project roadmap.
